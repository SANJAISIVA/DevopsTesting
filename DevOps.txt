Azure DevOps Board:
1. Work Items --> To track our tasks and user stories. 
		  Split every feature to separate module.

2. Board  ------> New, Active, Resolved (These 3 comes under Developer Roles), and 
		  Closed (After the testing the work item will go into closed State).

3. Backlogs ----> If you are working in a application with 10 features you can't do everything at once.
		  The untouched feature works will stay here. Once the ongoing feature(User Story) is 
		  complete then we pull the next feature that we need to work on.

4. Sprint  -----> 1 sprint lasts for 1 or 2 weeks. Assigning a feature to the sprint means that 
		  within a deadline we should finish the task, in the worst case senario move that
		  feature work to next Sprint. And after finishing one particular feature work, we
		  can deliver the product after each sprint means, Continuous delivery.
